Demonstration application for the [TC39 signals video](https://youtu.be/HSVcZa5yTKE)

# Installation and Running

```bash
pnpm i
pnpm dev
```

# Issues

For some reason you may have to first disable the `ReactShoppingCart` in `index.astro` and then re-add it before it compiles properly for the first time.
